### Discord Integration

    #### Link Discord
    - Before linking your discord, please make sure you're the owner of the server you're trying to use. After that, invite our bot to your server via [this link](https://discord.com/oauth2/authorize?client_id=1245799828114374786&scope=bot&permissions=2146958847).
    - After the bot is in your server, link your discord on our dashboard.
    
    #### Require Login with Discord
    - Forces the customers to link the discord before checkout can take place. (**if** before purchase is enabled)

    #### Before & After Purchase
    - Before: When enabled, after the user inserts their email or is logged in to their account, it will ask them to link their discord once and link it to their customer account for any future usage.
    - After: When enabled, when the order is completed if the discord has been previously linked, it will attempt to join either a different discord, or add roles in the existing server, if you choose the same server but a different role.
