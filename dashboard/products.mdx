        #### Title and description
        - The title and short description for your product.

    ### Image

    ### Variants
        Variants allow you to have multiple choices inside a product, for example, lets say you're selling a product which sells daily, weekly, monthly and yearly licenses, you can create a variant for each type and they will all have different settings between them.

        #### Pricing
        - Here lies the variant's price and the currency (defaults to the store settings)

        #### Product Type
        - You can hop between Serials or Service (the difference between both is that for serials you can add a list of serials keys and the stock will be derived from the list you have input. As for service, the maximum stock is unlimited, however if you want to have a max quantity you can press "Set how many times this service can be sold" and placing your number there).

        #### Stock delimiter
        - This option will only be present when Serials has been selected as the product type. It allows for flexibility depending on how you want the data to be structured.

        #### Additional information
        - Here you can optionally add a special note to your customer with more information about what he needs to do in order to redeem the product or how to setup what he bought in general.
        - Optionally, you may also redirect the user somewhere else via url after checkout.

        #### Meta title
        - Here you can optionally have a title for the meta tags, this is great for indexing on search engines and embeds for applications.
