## Coupon categories

    ### General
        
        #### Coupon code
        - The code your customers will use for the coupon.

        #### Coupon value
        - When it's fixed amount, the discount is one-time only. This means that regardless of what is purchased, the discount will only be applied once per product. (If a product is 10€ and your discount is 2€, we will charge 8€ for every product regardless of quantity)
        - When it's percentage, the discount is discounted on the overall order. An example that replicates the behavior above would be 20%.

        #### Start & End Date
        - Select the date from when your coupon will start/stop working (keep in mind it's not your local time, rather server time, which is set at UTC+0)

        #### Payment Methods
        - Select the payment methods which this discount will work on. (When none are selected, all payment methods are allowed)

        #### Products
        - Select the products which this discount will work on. (When none are selected, all products will have the discount)
