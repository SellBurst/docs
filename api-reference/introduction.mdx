## Authentication

All API endpoints are authenticated using Bearer tokens and picked up from the specification file.

```
Authorization: Bearer YOUR_API_KEY
```

## Multi-Store Support

If you're looking to use the API on a store that isn't your default, you can do so by passing the `X-Merchant` header with the Store Name.
